The Caribbean is right there inviting you to swim, snorkel and go fishing. For some real beach-holiday relaxation, take a boat trip out to fabulous Isla Mujeres, where you can snorkel off the reef and then enjoy the beach club’s facilities. Cocktails are optional. Cancun is also, of course, about the Mayan civilization. A trip to the vast pyramidal temple complex of Chichen Itza is an experience best had in the early morning before the heat gets too oppressive. If history is your thing, you’ll also need to visit the archeological zone of Coba, whose Nohoch Muul pyramid is the tallest in the Yucatan. At the walled Mayan city of Tulum, you’ll be charmed by the ruins right alongside the sapphire waters. When you’ve had enough pyramids and soothing facials, go crazy with activities such as cliff diving, rope swinging, cycling, kayaking and rope-bridge walking at Xel-Ha Eco-waterpark, which also has a truly impressive natural aquarium. Remember to bring your waterproof sunscreen!",

Along the Corniche, find the perfect bar or club to enjoy a balmy evening out.Short distances from Casablanca are the equally fascinating towns of Fez and Rabat. In Fez, you can see the new and old medinas, some traditional souks, the impressive Attarine Medersa (Islamic school) and the Karaouine mosque – the second largest in Morocco.

One glass of Gavi DOCG, a white wine to be enjoyed both young and aged, expresses the delicate yet elegant smells of the acacia flowers blooming in the spring, almonds and honey, as well as the fresh, savory taste of this rich land, antique like its winemaking tradition that dates back to 972. It is precisely in this period that the surprising liveliness of the Oltregiogo, the inland area of Genova, began to develop. This is a rich and fertile land, crossed by the Via del Sale and the Via Postumia, the main business streets that were established after the feud between the men of Zena, who already controlled the sea traffic of the area. Today, this area still mirrors the ancient ways of Genova in its architecture, territorial identity, language and especially its cuisine heavy in vegetables and fish. And there you have it - this unique land called Piedmont is home to one of the most important white wines, the Gavi DOCG. A still yet to be explored corner where you can find slow tourism and travel paths linked closely to nature and the beauty of the uncontaminated landscapes including the Nature Reserve of the Piedmont Apennines and many picturesque places glorified by antique villas and country homes. History and culture mix in the discrete luxury of the country resorts, golf clubs and worthy local sights such as the Museo dei Cappuccini di Voltaggio, the archaeological area of Libarna in Serravalle Scrivia and the Musei dei Campionissimi (dedicated to cycling) in Novi Ligure.",

You can hang out at the beach or explore the Art Deco streets of Old Miami, where you’ll find the Villa Vizcaya museum and garden. Food is central to the Miami experience. A tour of Little Havana is a must if you want to try some traditional specialties while also enjoying the music, the art and perhaps a fine hand-rolled cigar. In some secret places, you can also learn more about the ‘black magic’ of the islands: Santeria. Further out into the ocean, Key West offers some of the best seafood and sunsets. Theme parks are naturally part of the experience. At Jungle Island you can meet a variety of animals in a tropical setting. Birds, monkeys, parrots, rare species and a massive tiger are great for children. At the Miami Seaquarium there are performing sea lions, dolphins and killer whales, as well as more sedate non-performers such as endangered manatees or turtles.",

      "content" : "City of culture. City of fashion. City of heavenly ice creams and yellow rice. If you listen to some people, Milan is a place where you’ll be ostracized for wearing a tracksuit in public. In truth, this is a great northern Italian city with as many faces as a fashionista.Leonardo da Vinci lived here for a while. You can visit the very vineyard where he relaxed while painting the Last Supper. Tickets can be hard to obtain for this most famous of meals, so it’s best to plan in advance. Afterwards, visit the Leonardo3 Museum, where you can learn more about the master’s life and see models of his creations.Milan rewards walking. From the Piazza Duomo, you can tour the colossal cathedral, the monumental Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, majestic La Scala and the old district of La Brera. Sforzesco Castle is a little further if you’d like to see the grandeur of Milan’s ruling dukes, while the city’s art galleries are a real treat for their permanent and ever-changing temporary exhibitions. If you need more labels in your life, take off the tracksuit and stroll the exclusive Via Monte Napoleone. Then, when you tire of past glories, go to the brand new Piazza Gae Aulenti to see the Unicredit Tower designed by architect César Pell.Beyond the city center, Milan’s districts offer different perspectives. Navigli is a cool network of canals whose bars and restaurants cast dancing reflections off the water at night. The previously blue-collar neighborhood of Isola has been reborn as a leafy oasis of notable street art, cafes, bars, boutiques, galleries and clubs – basically, hipster central. Citta Studi around Piazza Leonardo is where the students congregate, and therefore where you’ll find some good craft beers.If Milan’s charms fade (unlikely), you’re in the middle of a region that offers you easy excursions to beautiful Lake Como, Verona, the wine country of Pavia and even Venice. The dolce vita begins here . . .",

The National Museum of Archeology is found in Naples as well as one of Italy’s oldest opera houses, the great ‘Teatro San Carlo’.

If you’re going to ‘do’ Paris, do it right.At the same time, remember there’s a whole other city waiting to be explored.

At the Fragonard Perfume Museum, you can create your own cologne.War enthusiasts, meanwhile, may be tempted to visit the nearby beaches of Normandy and see the D-Day battlefields first hand.

From Punta Arenas you can travel the roads leading to the Seno Otway, place of great touristic and scientific interest, where the Pingüinera is found. There, visitors can see hundreds of Magellanic penguins that nest between the months of October and March.Punta Arenas visitors should make sure to follow the tradition of touching or kissing the foot of the Indian Aónikenk from the monument to Magellan, located in the Square Muñoz Gamero. They say that those who follow this ritual will come back to Patagonia.",

When the weather gets too hot, flee the traffic and noise to nearby Petropolis – a curious German settlement where the architecture is quite bizarre.

      "content" : "The name of this Scottish town comes from Saint Andrew the Apostle. The presence of an important church since the 8th century first, and of a bishopric since the 11st century then, were decisive to the origin of a settlement which grew to the West of St Andrews cathedral. As burgh, it soon became the ecclesiatical capital of Scotland, at least until the Scottish reformation - the famous cathedral, which was the largest in Scotland, now is in ruins. The small city - former royal burgh - is on the East coast of Fife in Scotland, 16 km South-East of Dundee and 50 km North-East of Edinburgh. Besides history, there are three reasons to prove the importance of Saint Andrews.\nThe first and more general is certainly related to tourism. Nature-based tourism - Saint Andrews is close to the sea - as well as monuments and venues - such as, for example, the Tower of Holy Trinity, St Andrews Castle or West Port - are worth considering (regarding museums, one can mention The British Golf Museum).\nA second reason is based on the local University, as University of St Andrews is the oldest in Scotland (1410), one of the oldest in the world and a very prestigious institution.\nLast but not least, the third reason is that St Andrews is universally recognized as \"home of golf\", due to the presences of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club, founded in 1754, which has legislative authority over the game in the world (US and Mexico excluded), and to St Andrews Links, structure which is now formed by seven public golf courses - the Balgove, Eden, Jubilee Course, Strathtyrum, the New Course, the new Castle Course and obviously the Old Course, dated back to 15th century as golf course. St Andrews Links is also the most frequent venue for The Open Championship, which is one of the four major championships in the world, and certainly the oldest.\nA huge tourism based on golf is a logical consequence of the story and prestige of this sport in Saint Andrews.",

Sintra is known for its many 19th-century Romantic architectural monuments, which has resulted in its classification as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Although its heritage in buildings and nature is the most visible face of the historic individuality of Sintra, a whole literary heritage has made the area a legendary reference in Portuguese culture. It has become a major tourist centre, visited by many day-trippers who travel from the centre and suburbs of the capital Lisbon. In addition to the Sintra Mountains and Sintra-Cascais Nature Park, the parishes of the town of Sintra are dotted with royal retreats, estates, castles and other buildings, including the mediaeval Castelo dos Mouros, the Pena National Palace and the Sintra National Palace.",

Strolling the Royal Botanic Garden reveals some crazy science-fiction plants, while a wander around Paddington, Kings Cross or The Rocks is an introduction to traditional Sydney bustle (and some fantastic bars/restaurants).

This four-mile/six km path takes you on a spectacular journey from the surfing paradise of Bondi Beach via Tamarama, Bronte and Clovelly beaches to the 270-degree views of the Coogee Pavilion. Alternatively, a short ferry ride from Circular Quay brings you to the 4000 animals of Taronga Zoo.A highly recommended excursion from the city is to the Blue Mountains, whose Three-Sisters rocks, tiny townships, waterfalls, cliffs and forests are astoundingly beautiful.

There are so many stories – both famous and infamous – about the place that a visit always comes with the spice of genuine adventure. A significant modernizing push in recent years means that you can now enjoy the benefits of an aspiring Morocco while still appreciating all of its historical and cultural wonders.There’s plenty to do. Enter the cobbled maze of the Kasbah via the Bab Haha gate and get lost among the traditional architecture. Or visit the Grand Mosque, which was a Roman temple and a Portuguese cathedral before it converted to Islam in the eighth century. The beaches are also quite stunning, and the Grand Socco is a wonderful shopping locale for buying traditional kaftans, nuts and fresh fruit. Treat yourself to a mint tea!Literature fans will want to make a pilgrimage to Rue Magellan, whose hotels accommodated Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg and William Burroughs. Nowadays, it’s where the town’s hipsters hang out. Fans of Paul Bowles’ “The Sheltering Sky” will want to visit the museum of the Tangier American Legation Institute for Moroccan Studies, whose rooms exhibit treasures related to the author.A great day trip from Tangier is Asilah, one of Morocco’s most beautiful and well-preserved old cities. Walk its Portuguese ramparts, see the El-Kamra tower and visit the Palais de Raissouli, where a notable pirate once lived. With its own summer arts festival, Asilah is definitely a cultural center worth visiting at any time of the year.",

The Rhine Falls, Mount Rigi and the medieval castle of Laufen are just short trips away, or you might consider a day in nearby Lucerne.
